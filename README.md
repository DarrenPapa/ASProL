    ASProL was designed to simulate a low level environment without the
  dangers of memory leaks and segmentation faults, this started as a side
  project but became more of a project. It was a descendant of a programming
  language I made "AOProL" (Add Only PROgramming Language) which only has
  addition for its main operaion with 7 other instructions.

  This might be come the replacement for CASProL, CASProL is more suitable
  for actual programming while ASProL is more for training. CASProL is not a
  very beginner friendly programming language and its the same for ASProL
  but they serve different purposes. I hope ASProL becomes an useful tool for training for memory management
  and memory safety.

  ASProL is an esoteric programming language since its syntax is bizarre
  it comes from CASProL actualy, I just reused some code from CASProL and
  tinkered with it to come up with ASProL. Please use ASProL well :)
