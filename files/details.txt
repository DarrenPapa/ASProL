ASProL - Details

  ASProL simulates a low level environment without the dangers of an actual one. ASProL is an
esoteric programming language, it's purpose is to train to user in managing memory. Don't worry
it doesnt have errors when you forget to free memory at the end of the program, it's esoteric
because it uses an unusual syntax, similar to assembly but still unusual. So if you're confused
by normal programming languages, DO NOT USE THIS ONE! Now use ASProL well if you can :)

ASProL's specs:

ASProL - Features

Memory management:
  - Pointers
  - Memory Allocation

Advance memory management:
  - Saving and loading disc files: snapshots of the interpreters current memory tape,
  these files are saved at the interpreter's local directory
  - Switching between registers and memory

Strings:
  - Copying
  - Concatination
  - Comparisons
  - Operations: such as sizeof_str

Operations:
  - Arithmetic operations: add, sub, mul, div and fdiv (floor division/integer division)
